## What is Poolarize?

Poolarize is a novel Automated Market Maker (AMM) protocol designed around the concept of virtual liquidity, enabling efficient token swaps with minimal capital requirements. This AMM distributes a main token and accepts various other tokens in exchange. Virtual pools simulate liquidity for non-main tokens, while an integrated oracle system ensures accurate pricing, using USD as the reference quote.

## Core Features

- **Virtual Liquidity Pools**: Only requires liquidity for the main token, reducing capital requirements
- **Oracle Integration**: Prices updated via oracles every 5 minutes
- **Two-Step Swaps**: All trades route through USD for accurate pricing
- **Capital Efficiency**: Minimizes liquidity requirements while maintaining market dynamics
